# Learning goals

In this lab, you are expected to learn/put in practice the following skills:

- Creating your own repo for JSC370
- Branching on GitHub
- Git workflow clone/commit/push
- Using pull requests (PR)

##### Download lab `.qmd` [here](https://github.com/JSC370/JSC370-2026/blob/main/labs/lab2/lab02-github.qmd)

# Part 1: Create JSC370 personal repo

1. Create a repo named JSC370 on GitHub, include `README.md` and `.gitignore`

2. Clone the repo to your local machine:

```sh
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd JSC370
```

3. Create a directory for your labs and add this lab file:

```sh
mkdir labs
cp /path/to/lab02-github.qmd labs/
```

4. Manually edit `.gitignore` to have GitHub ignore MS Word `.docx` files (add `*.docx` to the file)

5. Stage, commit, and push all changes:

```sh
git add .
git commit -m "Add labs directory with lab02"
git push
```

### Add link to your repo below in the cell chunk:

```sh

```

# Part 2: Updating a single shared repo

One of the most common tasks that people uses git for is for collaborating. While in general team members organize such that there are no overlapping editing of the files, git is smart enough to avoid clashes when multiple edits are done in the same document[^multiedits]. To show this, we will do a collaborative edit of a file!

[^multiedits]: Team-members could be working on the same file but editing
different lines of code. If this is the case, after pull/push, git will integrate
the changes without conflicts.

We will be working with the repository [https://github.com/JSC370/JSC370-lab2-2026-whoami](https://github.com/JSC370/JSC370-lab2-2026-whoami)

## Step 1: Clone the repo and create a branch

Branching is a core feature of Git that allows you to create an independent line of development. When you create a branch, you're making a copy of the code at that point in time where you can make changes without affecting the main branch. This is how teams collaborate: each person works on their own branch, then proposes their changes via a **pull request** (i.e. "I have this great update to the project! Would you like to add it by *pulling* my branch into main?").

First, clone the repository to your local machine using the `git clone` command:

```sh
cd <your-directory>
git clone <repository-url>
```

Once you have the repository on your local machine, create a new branch for your changes. Use your name or a descriptive name for the branch[^branchnames]:

[^branchnames]: For more on branch naming conventions, see [Naming conventions for Git Branches](https://medium.com/@abhay.pixolo/naming-conventions-for-git-branches-a-cheatsheet-8549feca2534).

```sh
cd <repository-name>
git switch -c <your-name>
```

The `-c` flag creates a new branch and switches to it. You can verify you're on your new branch by running:

```sh
git branch
```

This will show all branches with an asterisk (*) next to your current branch.

When you're ready to push your local branch to the remote repository for the first time, use:

```sh
git push --set-upstream origin your-name
```

This sets up tracking between your local branch and the remote, so future pushes can simply use `git push`. Now you're ready to make changes without affecting the main branch!

## Step 2: Modifying the corresponding line

If you got the correct copy, you should find a very simple repository with only
two files: `.gitignore` and `README.md`. The first file is just a reference file
for git to know what things it should be "looking at" (checkout the lecture
slides), so we will **ignore it** at this time (pun intended). The second file
is the one that we will be playing with. The README file, which happens to be
a [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) file, contains, or at least
will contain, your and your team members biographies. Here is what you need to
do:

1. Find the line with your name.

2. In that single line (i.e. not spanning multiple lines), write something about
yourself, e.g. "I am from XYZ, I love doing ABC, ...".

3. (optional) if you feel like it, add at the end of the line a picture
of yourself (or avatar) using either html or markdown. This will require you
to include the figure in the repo (if you are not linking a web fig).

4. Commit the changes and push the changes to your branch using `git commit` and
`git push`, e.g.

```sh
git add .
git commit -m "[A short but meaningful message]"
git push
```

You are now one step closer to make your first "pull request". We will see how
that happens in the next part.


## Step 3: Do the pull request

This is the final step. Overall, pull requests (PR) are as complex as the proposed
changes are. The PR that you are about to make should go smoothly, yet, any time
that you make a new PR, the changes should be able to be **merged** in the original
repository without conflicts. Conflicts may only appear if the proposed changes
are out-dated with respect to the main repository, meaning that the main repository
was modified *after* you created your branch and your proposed changes cannot be merged without
generating conflicts[^mergeconflicts]. For now, let's just look at the simple case.

[^mergeconflicts]: More info about how to deal with conflicts in this very neat
post on stackoverflow.com [How to resolve merge conflicts in Git](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/161813/how-to-resolve-merge-conflicts-in-git?page=1&tab=votes#tab-top).
GitHub also has a way to solve conflicts in PRs, but this is only available to
the admins of target repo. More info [here](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/resolving-a-merge-conflict-on-github).


To create the PR, you just need to go to the repository on GitHub and
click on the "Compare & pull request" button for your branch:

<figure>
<img src="pull.png" width="600px">
<figcaption>Source: Screenshot</figcaption>
</figure>

This will create a PR in the reference repository. GitHub will automatically
analyze the PR and check whether merging the PR to the main branch will result
in a conflict or not. If all is OK, then the owner/admin of the repository can
merge the PR. Otherwise, if there's a conflict, you can go back to your local
repo, make the needed changes, commit the changes, and push the changes to
your branch. In this stage, the PR will automatically update to reflect
the new changes you made.
